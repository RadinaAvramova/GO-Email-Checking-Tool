# GO Email Checking Tool
Welcome to the GO Email Checking Tool project! This repository contains a tool implemented in Go that enables users to check the validity of email addresses and perform various checks on email-related tasks.

## Features
1. **Email Validation:** Validates the syntax and format of email addresses to ensure they adhere to the standard email address format.

2. **Domain Verification:** Verifies the existence of the domain associated with the email address, ensuring that the domain is valid and reachable.

3. **MX Record Lookup:** Performs MX (Mail Exchange) record lookup to determine the mail servers responsible for accepting email messages for the domain.

4. **SMTP Connection Test:** Establishes a connection to the SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server associated with the email domain to check its availability and responsiveness.

5. **Catch-All Detection:** Detects whether the email domain has a catch-all configuration, allowing it to accept emails addressed to any mailbox under the domain.

## Installation
To set up the GO Email Checking Tool:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/RadinaAvramova/GO-Email-Checking-Tool.git

2. **Navigate to the Directory:** Change your current directory to the location of the cloned repository:

cd GO-Email-Checking-Tool

3. **Install Dependencies:** Install any dependencies required for the project, including Go packages and libraries specified in the project.

4. **Build the Application:** Build the GO application using the appropriate commands for your environment.

## Usage
1. **Check Email Validity:** Run the tool with the email address as an argument to check its validity and perform various checks on it:

go run main.go example@example.com

2. **View Results:** Review the output of the tool, which includes information about email validity, domain verification, MX records, SMTP connection status, and catch-all configuration.

3. **Interpret Results:** Interpret the results to determine the status of the email address and its associated domain, including any potential issues or errors encountered during the checks.

## Customization
1. **Additional Checks:** Extend the tool with additional checks or validations based on specific requirements or use cases, such as SPF (Sender Policy Framework) or DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) verification.

2. **Output Formatting:** Customize the output format of the tool to present the results in a user-friendly and informative manner, including options for logging, reporting, or exporting results.

3. **Concurrency:** Implement concurrent processing and parallel execution of checks to improve performance and efficiency, especially when handling a large number of email addresses.
